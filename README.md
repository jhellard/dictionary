## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Tanstack/React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Handling API Data

### What I learned

I had limited experience using React Query going in, but thanks to [Web Dev Simplified's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8Dg0KVnfMA), I was able to quickly pick it up and start using it in the project, I love how easy it is to handle loading, error, and success states.

I had not used the JS .some method before, using it here to check whether the audio file existed was extremely handy.

TailwindCSS was something I wanted to use more extensively in a project, I have a ton of experience in CSS/SCSS (Mostly thanks to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)) and found the transition fairly straight-forward. I plan to continue using it in the future as my main struggle with CSS was thinking of all the 'best practice' class names. - I still have a lot to learn with Tailwind but am eager to keep using it.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - These docs are so good it is a breeze to find anything you need.
- [Toggle Switch](https://codepen.io/fydsa) - Saba Alikhani makes some amazing components, I took his Toggle switch and converted it mostly over to Tailwind.
